## About Version Control 


- Version control is a software that help to track 
changes to a code or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. As a developer edits code, the version control system takes a snapshot of the files. It then saves that snapshot permanently so it can be recalled later if needed.

- It allows multiple people to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other's changes and makes it easy to track and revert changes.

- Version control ek system hain jo ki apke code ko track kr ne main help kr ta hain ye bta ta hain ki aap ne kub or kiss line main code main changing kiya hain. ye aap k code ka screen shot le k use save krta hain ki jub aap ko jarurt ho aap apne code ke changes ko revert kr sakte hain.
  
## Types of Version Control Systems: 
1. Local Version Control Systems
2.  Centralized Version Control Systems
3.  Distributed Version Control Systems

- Local Version Control Systems are systems that operate on a single computer or device and track different versions of files. These systems work independently without the need for a central server
  
- Ek simple tarika local version control system kaam karta hai jaise ki ek folder mein multiple copies ya versions of a file rakhte hain. Har baar jab koi changes kiya jaata hai, ek naya version banaya jaata hai aur purana version ko preserve kiya jaata hai. Is tarah se, har ek version ka purana history milta hai, lekin yeh system kisi aur ke saath collaboration ke liye suitable nahi hota.
  

- Local version control systems ka istemal aksar personal projects ya small-scale development mein hota hai, jahan multiple logon ki collaboration ki zarurat nahi hoti. Examples of local version control systems include keeping multiple copies of files with different names (like adding a date or version number to the file name) or using simple scripts to create backups of files with timestamps..
