## JavaScript Operators

- javaScript main Operators  ka use kr k hum different    mathematical and logical Operators kr skta hain jese ki operators ka use kr k hum javaScript main  Addition(+) ,  Multiplication(*) aur bhi mathematical operation kr skte hain.

- In JavaScript, operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They allow you to perform arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and other operations. 




At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7.

The expression 3 + 4 is an example of the second type. This expression uses the + operator to add 3 and 4 together and produces a value, 7. However, if it's not eventually part of a bigger construct (for example, a variable declaration like const z = 3 + 4), its result will be immediately discarded â€” this is usually a programmer mistake because the evaluation doesn't produce any effects.

As the examples above also illustrate, all complex expressions are joined by operators, such as = and +. In this section, we will introduce the following operators:
