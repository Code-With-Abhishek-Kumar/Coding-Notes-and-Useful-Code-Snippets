## What is If Statement


if is a conditional statement that allows you to execute a block of code based on a specified condition. If the condition is true, the block of code will be executed. If the condition is false, the block of code will be skipped.


It allows you to create conditional logic in your programs.

```js
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if the condition is true
}

```





## Why use If Statement

If statements are used to make decisions in code. They allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. This can be useful for creating more dynamic and flexible programs.
