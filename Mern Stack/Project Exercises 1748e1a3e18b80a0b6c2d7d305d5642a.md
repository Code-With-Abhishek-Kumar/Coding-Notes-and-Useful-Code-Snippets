- **Description:** Create a simple `microservice` using Node.js and Express. The microservice will handle a specific function, such as managing a “Product” entity, with endpoints for `adding`, `retrieving`, `updating`, and `deleting` products. Use MongoDB as the database.
- **Skills Covered:**
    - Building microservices with Node.js and Express.
    - Designing `RESTful` APIs
    - `CRUD` operations with MongoDB
    - `Modular` application structure for microservices

### **Project Exercise 57: Build an API Gateway with Event-Driven Communication**

- **Topic Covered:** API Gateway for `Microservices` & `Redis Pub/Sub.`
- **Description:** Create an API Gateway using Express.js to route requests to multiple microservices. Implement `event-driven` communication between these microservices using Redis Pub/Sub. For example, the API Gateway routes requests to an Order service, which then notifies a User service about a new order via `Redis` Pub/Sub. Add features like rate limiting and authentication at the API Gateway level for `security`.
- **Skills Covered:**
    - API Gateway setup with Express.js.
    - Proxying requests and routing.
    - Redis Pub/Sub for inter-service communication.
    - Event-driven architecture.
    - Security features like authentication and rate limiting.

### **Project Exercise 58: Deploy a Node.js App to AWS**

- **Topic Covered:** Cloud Deployment.
- **Description:** Launch an `AWS` `EC2` instance and set up the necessary environment for deploying a Node.js application. Configure `NGINX` as a reverse proxy to handle incoming traffic and link a custom domain to your app for seamless access.
- **Skills Covered:**
    - Setting up AWS EC2 instances.
    - Setting up AWS EC2 instances.
    - Installing and `running` a Node.js app on the cloud.
    - Configuring NGINX as a reverse proxy.
    - Domain masking and `DNS` setup for custom domains.

### **Project Exercise 59: Deploy with DigitalOcean App Platform**

- **Topic Covered:** Simplified Deployment.
- **Description:** `Deploy` a multi-container application using `DigitalOcean’s` App Platform. Explore its simplicity by setting up services, and test `scalability` by configuring replicas for your app.
- **Skills Covered:**
    - Deploying applications on DigitalOcean App Platform.
    - Managing multi-container setups.
    - `Scaling` `applications` by adding replicas.
    - `Monitoring` application `performance`.
